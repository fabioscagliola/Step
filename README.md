# Step

Step is a video game, currently under development, inspired by [The Long Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Earth), the first novel in a collaborative science fiction series by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter.

The purpose of the game is to help Joshua reach his goal by avoiding the obstacles; the only action that Joshua can take is a *step* into another earth; this beta includes three earths only (Datum Earth, East 1, and West 1), but a variety of earths will be a key feature of the final version of the game.
